In this course, you will be reflecting weekly on your progress through the course, culminating in a final grade that you assign yourself based on an honest assessment of your understanding of the course material. 

# Weekly Meetings

At the beginning of class, you signed up for weekly meetings with me. These will be 15 minutes long, and at each meeting we'll address the following:

1. What are you really excited/doing well with/know a lot about in class right now?
2. What are you struggling with, and how can we make sure you can continue to learn that material?

**Meetings are mandatory.** If you miss or can't make a meeting, you must reschedule with me. 

To put it another way, meetings are held in this class **in lieu of exams**. They are my primary way of gauging your personal understanding of the material, and your primary way of gaining honest, 1-on-1 feedback from me periodically. **Missing meetings are like missing exams; they must be made up.**

**You can always schedule a longer meeting with me in lieu of your 15-minute check-in** if you feel you have more to discuss; just send me an email and/or request a meeting with me through Outlook during any time I am free. 

# Weekly Reflections

To help you stay on track, every week you have **weekly reflections** due. You have these due **even on weeks you don't have a weekly meeting with me**. 

If I had arbitrarily large amounts of time, we would meet every week, but I don't and neither do you; weekly reflections are a way for you to practice reflection without me, and for me to check in on you regularly. 

**Reflections are due BEFORE CLASS on Fridays.**

# Final Reflection

Your final reflection will consist of:

1. A letter of at least one page which details (a) what grade you are assigning yourself, (b) a justification for this grade which addresses each overall learning objective for the class, and (c) what you are taking away from this class _other than a letter grade_.
2. The three pieces of work for the class that you are most proud of.
3. The three pieces of work for the class that you most feel you could do better, if you had another 2 weeks of class.

More information will be available later in the term.

# FAQ and Guidelines

## What Grade Should I Get?

The grade you give yourself.

As a reminder, here is the grading guidelines from the syllabus:

Grade | What it Says to You | What it Says to Others 
---- | ---- | ---- |
F | I did not gain any new skills, knowledge, or experiences from being in this course. | This person did not meet any of the course goals.
D | I gained some new skills and knowledge from this course, but it is a shaky foundation. I have developed some new understanding of the course goals, but would not be able to build upon them in practice without serious revision. | This person barely met the minimum goals for the course.
C | I gained enough new skills and knowledge from this course to have a foundation in the topics. I can continue to build on my understanding in practice, but I have some basic skills to continue to revisit as well. | This person has met the minimum requirements for the course and mostly grasps those minimum requirements.
B | I gained new skills and knowledge appropriate for a solid foundation in the topics. I am confidently able to build on my understanding and continue learning and refining. | This person has completely fulfilled the standards for the course and is successful at those standards.
A | I gained enough new skills and knowledge in the course that, in order to continue to be challenged, I had to extend _beyond_ the course material. | This person has challenged themselves beyond the standards for the course and met that challenge.

## Why Don't You Just Give Us Normal Grades?

Grading is supposed to flatten your achievements over 10 weeks into one letter. That is very silly, and an attempt to say what is and isn't worth an "A" vs. "B" vs. "C" based on the effort of a human being over an entire course where you are constantly learning and changing is one of the most ridiculous aspects of the education system. 

## Okay, But What Grade Should I Give Myself, Really?

Here is the best concrete advice I can give you: **your grade should be inversely correlated with your regrets.** If you give yourself an A, you should be saying to yourself, there was nothing more I could have gotten out of that class; I am done hearing from Professor Ackles about algorithms for the rest of my life. If you give yourself a B, you should be saying, I did pretty well in that class and I understood it, but I could have pushed myself more; I could have tried a little harder on that one problem set and I didn't really go back to it; I could have asked more questions, but ah well; such is life. Et cetera. 

This is not to say that an A requires perfection; in fact, quite the opposite. An A requires _continual effort to understand your failures_, as well as doing a good job. (To continue with this explanation, a B requires you to do a good job. A C requires you to do an acceptable job, and a D requires you to do a job. An F requires nothing.)

## What if My Grade is Too High or Too Low?

Your weekly reflections for weeks 8 and 9 should be approaching your final grade asymptotically. If I disagree with your self-assigned grade in week 8 or week 9, it will come up at your reflection meeting.

If your grade is too high, we'll make a concrete list of actions you have to take to get to the grade you want. 

If your grade is too low, we'll list out together all the ways in which you have succeeded beyond what you realize. 

Your "final" grade is due to me at the end of Week 10, before finals week. At that point, if there is a discrepancy between your assigned grade and the criteria we decide upon together during week 8 or 9, the previous agreement will take priority. (That is, if we decide you have a C and need to revise 3 assignments for a B, and you do not revise them but give yourself a B anyway, you will receive a C.)
