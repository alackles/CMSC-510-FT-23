# Course Content and Goals

_For the schedule, see [schedule](/CMSC-150-FT-23/schedule)._

## Course Philosophy

Everyone in this classroom--both students and professor--is capable of learning more.

## Learning Guideline

This course serves three basic purposes (or _learning objectives_) in the Computer Science curriculum. By the time you leave this class, we hope that you:

1. Gain exposure to a variety of common algorithms used in everyday software development.
2. Understand mechanistically how to develop, evaluate, and implement a novel algorithm.
3. Sharpen your skills in reflective learning.

Below is a more specific _guideline_ for these learning objectives, as well as what I, the professor, should do to support you in these goals. 

Topic | Objective | Professor's Role
--- | --- | ---
Variety.1 | I can describe the general purpose and applicable scenarios for a variety of common algorithms. | Expose students to multiple common algorithms and their associated applications.
Variety.2 | I am able to translate pseudocode or conceputal versions of algorithms into C++ efficiently. | Give students chances to translate between C++ and pseudocode for a variety of algorithms.
Mechanism.1 | I can look at an unfamiliar problem and identify similar underlying structures between this problem and problems I have solved in the past | Provide students with opportunities to draw connections between learned algorithms and novel problems.
Mechanism.2 | I have experience taking a 'deep dive' into one or more algorithms and going through the process of algorithm concept and implementation start-to-end. | Give students detailed information and opportunities to work deeply on developing an algorithm for a particular data structure.
Reflect.1 | I have a strong sense of my own strengths and weaknesses via learning through dialogue | Participate in dialogue with students about their strengths and weaknesses
Reflect.2 | I have gained greater comfort with discomfort, failure, and unfamiliarity | Cultivate a classroom environment which supports and encourages safe exploration of discomfort, failure, and unfamiliarity 
Reflect.3 | Reflect compassionately and critically on your learning at the conclusion of the term | Reflect compassionately and critically on students' learning and my teaching at the conclusion of the term

Think of this as a list of statements that you can answer as "True/False"; at the beginning of the term, they may mostly or all be "False", but at the end of the term, if you have gotten all you can out of the course, you should be able to confidently answer "True".

# Grades

## Attendance

Attendance is tracked. It is not mandatory, but it is strongly advised. 

Consistently attending class is the easiest thing you can do to succeed in the course. Choosing not to attend class (if you are able) will almost always create _more_ work in the long run, rather than less. 

## Assignments & Late Policy

- Assignments are due at the time indicated on GitHub Classroom.
- You can take a 24-hour extension at any time for any assignment by emailing me **before** the assignment due date. 
  - No reason is required.
  - If an emergency prevents you from emailing before, or if you need a longer extension or have extenuating circumstances, you can and should still email me (you still do not have to provide a reason).
- Late assignments receive no feedback
  - You can still complete them, and use them to construct/argue your final grade.
  - Assignments turned in during an extension period are not considered "late" and will be given feedback as normal.

## Learning Assessment

This course is **ungraded**. At the end of the term, you will self-assign a grade (A - F) which, to the best of your ability, accurately reflects both your efforts and final understanding.

The purpose of grades are twofold: to give yourself some final closure on your success in a course, and to demonstrate to others by shorthand how good you were at meeting the goals of a particular course. (Some people see grades as a mark of how much you know about a topic, but in general, grades are a very bad measurement of knowledge.) 

You should therefore choose a grade that is a good proxy for both measurements, but I encourage you to put more emphasis on the former (closure for yourself). Below is a guideline. 

Grade | What it Says to You | What it Says to Others 
---- | ---- | ---- |
F | I did not gain any new skills, knowledge, or experiences from being in this course. | This person did not meet any of the course goals.
D | I gained some new skills and knowledge from this course, but it is a shaky foundation. I have developed some new understanding of the course goals, but would not be able to build upon them in practice without serious revision. | This person barely met the minimum goals for the course.
C | I gained enough new skills and knowledge from this course to have a foundation in the topics. I can continue to build on my understanding in practice, but I have some basic skills to continue to revisit as well. | This person has met the minimum requirements for the course and mostly grasps those minimum requirements.
B | I gained new skills and knowledge appropriate for a solid foundation in the topics. I am confidently able to build on my understanding and continue learning and refining. | This person has completely fulfilled the standards for the course and is successful at those standards.
A | I gained enough new skills and knowledge in the course that, in order to continue to be challenged, I had to extend _beyond_ the course material. | This person has challenged themselves beyond the standards for the course and met that challenge.

# Classroom Policies 

## Policies in Brief

- Accomodations are granted upon request. I will never argue with you about an accomodation you request, even if you do not have official documentation. 
- Stay home if you are sick. If you attend class and are sick, especially with a respiratory illness, you may be asked to leave.
- You are a human being with obligations, hobbies, and priorities which both encompass and extend beyond this course.

## Plagiarism

Being able to synthesize original ideas is the most difficult part of being a student. It is also the only part that matters. 

Plagiarism, or academic dishonesty, is defined in this classroom as _obfuscating, purposefully or accidentally, the origin of an idea._

Plagiarism is academia's biggest taboo because academia is fundamentally about producing, sharing, and validating ideas, and about finding the difference between ideas you _learn_ and ideas you _create_. When you hide the origin of an idea, you fail to participate in academic study.

If you are ever unsure, please ask me; it is okay not to be sure. In fact, if you never ask me "is it plagiarism to use x, y, or z?", you probably either aren't doing much of your own exploration or are just hiding some plagiarism. 

Here are two general guidelines: 
- Using textbooks, videos, and forums is not plagiarism so long as you are (1) using these resources to _generate ideas_, not to _find others' ideas_, and (2) consistently crediting your sources. If the source you credit makes it look like you have plagiarized, that is still better than submitting with no source. 
- Working with a friend is not plagiarism so long as you are each generating your own ideas in concert with each other. As a rule of thumb, if you find yourself typing and are not sure what or why you are typing, that is plagiarism. It's time to back up and find the idea for yourself.
- **Using generative AI (chatGPT, large language models) to complete assignments is plagiarism by default**, because chatGPT plagiarizes by default. Certainly there are good ideas to be found there, but they are _not chatGPT's ideas_; you have no idea whose ideas they are. As a model which mix-and-matches existing text to its own sentences, it purposefully obfuscates the origin of all ideas it presents.
