# Learning Goals

Topic | Objective | Professor's Role
---- | ---- | ----
Mechanism.1 | I can look at an unfamiliar problem and identify similar underlying structures between this problem and problems I have solved in the past | Provide students with opportunities to draw connections between learned algorithms and novel problems.
Reflect.2 | I have gained comfort with discomfort, failure, and unfamiliarity | Cultivate a classroom environment which supports and encourages safe exploration of discomfort, failure, and unfamiliarity 

# Notes

## Induction

1. State what you are trying to prove.
2. State your base case.
3. Assume the _k_ case.
4. Prove tha the _k_ case implies the _k+1_ case.
5. Celebrate.

## Proofwriting Tips

- Write out your statements
- Write out your definitions
- Write out your definitions again but better this time
- Simplify, simplify, simplify
- Do not use what you are tryng to prove in the proof!
- Stick to one side of an equality at a time
- Not every proof requires the same style

# Practice Problems

## Warm-Up Problem

Prove, using induction, that:

$$\sum_{i=0}^n i = \frac{(n)(n+1)}{2}$$

## Extension Problems

Prove that every amount of postage of 12 cents or more can be formed using just 4-cent and 5-cent stamps.
