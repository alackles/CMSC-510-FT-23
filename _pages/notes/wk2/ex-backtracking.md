The purpose of the exercise today is to continue thinking about new and intuitive strategies for problem solving using our strategy of _building up from smaller, simpler cases_. 

To this end, I'm giving you a single problem to work on as a group for the day. You have three "help tokens", and you an turn them in at any time for a nudge towards the next step of the approach. But once they're gone, they're gone. 

At the end of the day, you are trying to create **an algorithm**, described in pseudocode. Your job as a group is to turn this algorithm in. 

# Problem of the Day

Given an _n_ x _n_ chessboard, **where can you place _n_ queens so that no two queens can attack each other in single movement**?

Describe an algorithm for placing _n_ queens. 

Then, create some pseudocode for that algorithm.
