# Agenda

Time | Activity | Purpose
---- | ---- | ----
9:50 - 10:10 | Warm-Up Problem | Apply material from the reading
10:10 - 10:30 | Recursion is Scary/C++ practice | Figure out why recursion feels so strange
10:30 - 11:00 | Extension Problems | Stretch and test our understanding of recursion while practicing proofwriting

# Learning Goals

Topic | Objective | Professor's Role
---- | ---- | ----
Mechanism.1 | I can look at an unfamiliar problem and identify similar underlying structures between this problem and problems I have solved in the past | Provide students with opportunities to draw connections between learned algorithms and novel problems.
Reflect.2 | I have gained comfort with discomfort, failure, and unfamiliarity | Cultivate a classroom environment which supports and encourages safe exploration of discomfort, failure, and unfamiliarity 

# Notes

## Recursion

- Recursion is like induction, but for code
- Sometimes problem that are easy to solve recursively are very difficult to solve iteratively
  - Sometimes the reverse is true too 
- Recursion has a lot of strengths, but we should think about what some weaknesses might be 

## Proofwriting Tips

- Write out your statements
- Write out your definitions
- Write out your definitions again but better this time
- Simplify, simplify, simplify
- Do not use what you are tryng to prove in the proof!
- Stick to one side of an equality at a time
- Not every proof requires the same style

# Practice Problems

## Warm-Up Problem

Write a recursive algorithm (in pseudocode) that computes _n!_. Recall that:

$$ n! = (n)*(n-1)*(n-2)*\cdots*1 $$

## Extension Problems

Translate the peasant multiply algorithm from your book (pg 23) into working C++ code.
